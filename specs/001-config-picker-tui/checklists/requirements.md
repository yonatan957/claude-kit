# Specification Quality Checklist: Config Picker & Configure Flow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- All items passed on first validation pass. The feature description (per
  `overview/claude-kit-ux-walkthrough-v2.html`) was detailed enough that no
  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed.
- Out-of-scope by design: the underlying install/removal transaction safety mechanics
  (snapshot/apply/verify/revert) are treated as a dependency of this flow, not part of it —
  they belong to a separate "install/remove transaction engine" feature.
